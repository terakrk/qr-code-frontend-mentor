## Overview

This is a QR code. It took me a while, but I'm proud of all I've learned.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This project helped me to practice Flexbox and using REM rather than pixels for accessiblity. I also learned I should slow down and pay attention to the style guide. ("Why doesn't this paragraph look right?" Because I haven't used the color the style guide told me to!)

### Continued development

Doing this project made me more confident using Flexbox, and I hope to continue practicing it (and CSS Grid.)

### Useful resources

- [Keep the Footer at the Bottom: Flexbox vs. Grid](https://moderncss.dev/keep-the-footer-at-the-bottom-flexbox-vs-grid/) by Stephanie Eckles - I had trouble getting the footer with the attribution to stay underneath the QR code, and this gave me a solution.
- [FLEX](https://flexbox.malven.co/) - This Flexbox cheat sheet helped me see Flexbox concepts in action. (Applying properties to a parent so the children will be affected is kind of counter-intuitive.)
